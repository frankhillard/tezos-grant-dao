## Workflow

![workflow](./images/workflow.png)

The contract is using locked tokens of the configured
***governance_token*** as voting power.  
The potential incentives to lock tokens (outside of getting voting power) is
uncovered.

### Propose

A token owner can *propose* a vote by supplying a ***description_link***,
and an optional tuple of type ***Lambda.t*** composed by a ***hash*** and a ***kind***.
As SPAM protection mechanism, the configured ***deposit_amount*** of tokens is
transferred from the owner to the DAO. This amount will be sent back to
the proposal creator if configured ***refund_threshold*** participation is
reached by the end of the vote.

### Lock

To convert their tokens to voting power, owners can *lock* them.
The lock mechanism consists in a transfer from the owner to the DAO contract address,
and tracking the balance of locked tokens in the storage.
Locking can only be done outside voting periods.

### Release

Token owners can also *release* their tokens, then the DAO contract
transfers locked token and updates the vault balance. Releasing can only be done
outside voting periods.

### Vote

After a configured ***start_delay*** elapsed time, token owners can *vote*
during a configured ***voting_period***. Token owners can vote on the proposal,
having their locked tokens being counted as voting power.

The `Voting Weight` in the D.A.O. is used to limit the influence of Whales
or synchronized groups on the voting processes. It is defined as follows : 
- `Voting Weight = x * y * z`
    - `x` being the number of tokens locked by the user,
    - `y` being the time since the user tokens were locked,
    - `z` being the user's voting activity, stored in a `map`.

### End_vote

After the ***voting_period*** has elapsed, anyone can *end_vote*.
The vote result is computed, according to configured ***quorum_threshold***
and ***super_majority***, either the proposal is ***Accepted***,
and a timelock is created, or the proposal is **Rejected**.
When Rejected, The ***deposit_amount*** is either sent back to the proposal
creator or burned if the ***quorum_threshold*** haven't been met.

### Cancel

The proposal creator can *cancel* the proposal outside the ***voting_period***
or the ***timelock_period***. The ***deposit_amount*** is burned.

### Execute

After a ***timelock_delay*** and for a ***timelock_period***, anyone can *execute*
a given lambda if it matches the hash associated to the proposal.
